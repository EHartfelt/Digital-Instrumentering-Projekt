/*
This file provides two functions:
isNewUser() - For checking and RFID tag with the EEPROM to see if there's a new user.
writeScore() - For checking if the new score is a highscore and writing it in the
EEPROM if it is. It returns 0 for a new highscore and returns the old highscore if the new score is worse.

To fully understand this code, it is important to know how the EEPROM is setup.
The first address 0 is the number of GPS-coordinates, 
the second address 1 contains the number of users (up to 255). 
Then the next 10*8=80 bytes are reserved for GPS-coordinates. 
Afterwards come the users in the race, where each user has 3 bytes 
reserved for initials, 5 for RFID and 4 for the highscore, where the most
significant byte is the first, down to the least significant. The first user's
first initial is at address 82 and the first RFID is at address 85.

For a user the data in the EEPROM looks like this:
First address = 172 as an example
172-174. Initials
175-179. RFID
180-183. Highscore split into 4 bytes B3 B2 B1 B0 with B3 at 180, B2 at 181, 
B1 at 182 and B0 at 183.

The next user starts at 172+12*n = 184 and so on. n={0, 1, 2,..., k}
